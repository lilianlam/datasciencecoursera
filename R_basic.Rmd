## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Week 1 module: Basic code
### get working directory
```{r getwd}
getwd()
```

### accessing .csv files into R
```{r read.csv}
read.csv()
```

### assigning a value/character to an object
```{r assign}
x <- 5 #numeric object
y <- 1:20 #prints out numbers 1-20
msg <- "hello" #character vector
```

### R objects can have attributes
-. names, dimension names  
-. dimensions (matrices, arrays)  
-. class  
-. length  
-. can be accessed using:  
```{r attributes}
attributes(msg)
```

### c() can be used to create/concatenate vectors of objects
```{r c}
x <- c(0.5,0.6) ##numeric
x <- c("a","b","c") ##character
```

### explicit coercion using as. functions
``` {r as}
x <- 0:6
class(x)
as.numeric(x)
as.character(x)
```

### lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes

### matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute of integer vector length 2 (nrow, ncol)
```{r matrix}
m <- matrix (1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m #matrix created by columns
dim(m) #dimension attribute of 2 rows and 3 cols
attributes(m) #prints 2 3
```

```{r matrix2}
m2 <- 1:10 
dim(m2) <- c(2,5) ##creating a matrix that is 2 row x 5 columns
dimnames(m2) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")) ##assigning rownames then colnames
m2
```

### using binding to make matrices
```{r bind}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
cbind(x,y)
rbind(x,y)
```

### factors represent categorical data: "male"/"female" instead of 1/2
levels are default alphabetical first: yes then no, unless specified
```{r factors}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"),
  levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```

### data frames store tabular data
-. unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column  
-. columns must be of same length   
-. attribute called row.names, which helps to annotate the data
-. created by read.table() or read.csv()
-. converted into a matrix by data.matrix()
